Billions died, civilization fell, and the city of angels was left a desolate zombie wasteland.  \r\n \r\nNow, a year later, the Mighty Dragon and his companions protect a last few thousand survivors in their film-studio-turned-fortress, the Mount. Scarred and traumatized by the horrors they’ve endured, the heroes fight the armies of ravenous ex-humans at their citadel’s gates, lead teams out to scavenge for supplies—and struggle to be the symbols of strength and hope the survivors so desperately need. \r\n \r\nBut the hungry ex-humans aren’t the only threats the heroes face.
